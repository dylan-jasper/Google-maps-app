# Trending Venues

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is a single-page application featuring a neighborhood with trending Foursquare locations. Functionality includes: map markers to identify popular locations, a search function to easily discover these locations, and a listview to support simple browsing of all locations.

Implemented third-party APIs include Google Maps and Foursquare.

Note that due to pricing changes on the Maps Platform, the API key is currently inactive.
